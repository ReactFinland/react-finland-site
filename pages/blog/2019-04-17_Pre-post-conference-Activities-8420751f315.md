Often when you go to a conference and have some free time, it can be difficult to figure out what to do. One thing that happened spontaneously in our previous event, [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi), was what we call a get-together in which some of the people coming to the conference literally get together and then do something (i.e. go to a bar, swimming, museum, you name it).

To facilitate this, I’ve gathered the current activity ideas to post to give you a starting point. You can also reach the other attendees through the conference Slack and there’s a specific channel, **#react-get-together**, for getting organized.

I have listed [the main parties and conference events in the previous post](/blog/parties-and-community-events-e7a22af12ea6/). You can also [refer to the schedule](https://react-finland.fi/schedule/) for up to date information.

> If you cannot access Slack for a reason or another, send us email (info <at> react-finland.fi) and we’ll add you there.

### Pre-conference Activities (23.04, Tuesday)

Before attending [React Helsinki meetup](https://meetabit.com/events/react-helsinki-april-2019), you could consider the following options:

#### Visiting Oodi — The New Central Library 🌧

Helsinki has a new central library, [Oodi](https://www.oodihelsinki.fi/en/). It’s not a standard library full of books but rather an interpretation of a library adapted to modern needs. Visiting it could be worthwhile if you are into architecture.

#### Visiting Suomenlinna Castle ☀️

You can find [Suomenlinna](https://www.suomenlinna.fi/en/), one of the most significant castles of Finland, right at Helsinki.

#### Swimming at Yrjönkatu swimming hall 🌧

Yrjönkatu swimming hall is the first public one in Finland opened in 1928. BBC says it’s one of the most beautiful ones in the world.

Given clothing is optional, it’s open for women on odd days and for men on even days. If you can find some time during the week, it’s a good chance to get a Finnish sauna experience.

### Post-conference Activities (27.04–28–04, Saturday-Sunday)

The previous activities are possible to Saturday as well. In addition, there are a couple of extra ones:

#### Visiting Linnanmäki Amusement Park ☀️

[Linnanmäki amusement park](https://www.linnanmaki.fi/en) opens in the weekend after the conference. Especially the wooden roller coaster is worth trying out.

#### The Carnival of Ice Cream and Chocolate 🌧

Finland’s first [carnival of ice cream and chocolate](https://www.jaatelojasuklaakarnevaali.fi/en/home/) takes place between 26th and 28th of April. If you like either or both, it’s a great chance to pick up some local flavour (liquorice ice cream anyone?).

#### Unofficial bar meet 🌧

We are planning an unofficial bar meet around 19:00 at the end of Saturday. We’ll publicize more information as we have it.

### Conclusion

I hope you’ll find an activity that fits to you. Above are some ideas on what to do. I didn’t mention the art galleries or museums for example. There’s also architecture to discover.

If you don’t want to go alone, please join **#react-get-together** channel in React Finland Slack and we’ll get organized.
