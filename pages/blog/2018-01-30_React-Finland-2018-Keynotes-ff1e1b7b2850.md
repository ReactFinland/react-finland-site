Keynotes are one of the defining features of a conference. They set the tone for further discussion and hence it’s important to choose them well. This time around we have two speakers well known in the React community: [Ken Wheeler](https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler) and [Jani Eväkallio](https://twitter.com/jevakallio).

#### Ken Wheeler — How React changed everything

This talk will examine how React changed the front end landscape as we know it. We’ll start by recounting the pre-React landscape, including prior art. Next, we’ll venture into the introduction of React, and its reception and growth.

But most importantly, we will take a look at the core idea of React, and why it transcends language or rendering target and posit on what that means going forward, including what React might look like years from now.

#### Jani Eväkallio — The New Best Practices

When React was first introduced, it was ridiculed for going against established web development best practices as we knew them. Five years later, React is the gold standard for how we create user interfaces.

Along the way, we’ve discovered a new set of tools, design patterns and programming techniques. In this talk, we’ll explore how we can apply the React philosophy to software engineering problems far beyond the React ecosystem.

#### Conclusion

We are fortunate to have two world class speakers to give keynotes at [React Finland 2018](https://react-finland.fi/). And the rest of the speakers are going to be amazing as well.

There are [still tickets left](https://react-finland.fi/#tickets) although we sold out our early birds for the presentations. Don’t visit Finland for weather, visit it for React.
