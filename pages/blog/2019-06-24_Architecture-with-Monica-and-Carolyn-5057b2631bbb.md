Even not having or thinking about architecture, means you’ll end up with one. Sometimes concrete structures can be identified from ad hoc ones that develop over times. As patterns are found, then also their strengths and weaknesses become more aware.

The question is, how to create architectures that last time and to develop tools that are more than just “intuitive”.

Why do we rewrite software? What’s the cost of refactoring? How to develop architectures that last time? It’s these questions that Monica Lent seeked to answer in her talk about building resilient frontend architectures.

#### Carolyn Stransky — “Intuitive” Tooling

A lot of tooling we use is marketed as intuitive. But what does that mean in the end? Intuitive to one person likely isn’t so to another. The topic boils into remembering we were all beginners once and being empathetic to that. In her talk, Carolyn explores the space further.

#### Conclusion

For me, having an architecture session at the end was the perfect way to finish the conference. There’s a lot to be learned from Monica’s and Carolyn’s talks and in some ways it boils down to being pragmatic and empathetic when developing software. Everyone was a beginner at some point.
