Finland — not too cold, not too hot. Just perfect.

Long story short, [tickets are available now](https://ti.to/react-finland/2018)! The pricing goes as below:

*   Presentations: 250€, 300€, 350€ depending on how fast you are. Early birds go cheaper.
*   Workshops: 150€, 200€ for half-day, 300€, 400€ for full-day. Same idea.

[Check out the conference site](https://react-finland.fi/) to learn more about it and our speakers. See you there!
