Given we had to postpone the physical portion of the React Finland to the next year, we'll run with the same themes in a mini-conference format. Each of the events covers a specific topic. Last time [we discussed design systems](/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-3-recap/).

## Overview

In the fourth edition, we'll focus on lessons learned. In particular, the goal is to learn about best practices with React while covering emerging technology related to it.

As usual, we have three sessions in store. Two will be in a "show and tell" format while the third talk about Reakit will be a traditional presentation. We're still iterating on the format and it feels like doing something more interactive works well online.

The event will take place 28th of October (17:30-20:10 Finnish time) and it's going to be available both in free and premium formats.

To "pay" for the free option, you'll see themed advertisements during the breaks while the premium stream receives the QA. The QAs will be available later and included to the videos that are shared after the event.

The free/premium split allows us to keep the event accessible for all while giving us a chance to try to cover production costs.

## Schedule

We have three speakers awaiting you and Juho Vepsäläinen will host the session. The event begins 17:30 and after the end panel (premium only), we continue with a relaxed Zoom meeting starting at 20:10 and ending whenever people head out to other things (officially 20:30).

I've listed the talks below. You can [learn more at the schedule](/schedule/).

### Luke Jackson - Oceanwind - 17:45-18:15

In this freeform session, Juho Vepsäläinen will discuss [Oceanwind](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/oceanwind) with Luke Jackson to understand why the styling solution exists and how it was developed. Oceanwind implements [Tailwind.css](https://tailwindcss.com/) class syntax but with a twist as it doesn't require [PurgeCSS](https://github.com/FullHuman/purgecss) to work and it can operate both in runtime and server-side rendering (SSR) modes.

### Diego Haz - Reakit – Toolkit for building accessible UIs - 18:25-18:55

In his talk, Diego Haz will discuss [Reakit](https://reakit.io/), a toolkit for building accessible UIs. See [the SurviveJS interview](https://survivejs.com/blog/reakit-interview/) to get an early idea of the solution.

### Mikhail Novikov - Lessons learned from burnout - 19:05-19:35

In this conversational session, Juho Vepsäläinen will discuss with Mikhail Novikov about the lessons he has learned from a burnout. I expect we'll see many concrete ways how to improve your well-being in these difficult times.

## What are the participation options

The session will be available in two formats - premium and free. The talks will be available freely through YouTube as we stream them simultaneously through another platform. Here's how the options differ:

- Free - Hosted on YouTube only, ads during breaks, minimal interactivity - 0 €
- Premium - Hosted on other platforms - You'll have full access to the event QAs and the end panel - 15 € (inc. VAT)

The talk videos will be available through our YouTube channel later after the event.
