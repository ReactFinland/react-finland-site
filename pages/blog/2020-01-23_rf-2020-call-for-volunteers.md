Organizing an event, such as React Finland, requires a lot of work and effort outside and during the conference. As an attendee most of the work is invisible and you won't notice anything unless something goes catastrophically wrong. To help with the effort, we're doing a traditional call for volunteers.

## Volunteering in React Finland 2020

As a volunteer, we expect you to support organizing for one day during the event. Usual tasks include registration, handling logistics, assembling goodie bags, supporting speakers (mics and timing), and making sure everyone is happy. In total, we are looking for 15-20 volunteers to help support the conference.

In return, you'll get access to the conference and related side events (including afterparty), receive conference swag (should you want to), and will be a part of the experience.

If you decide to volunteer for two days, you can participate in a workshop (exact workshop will be figured out closer to the conference depending on capacity).

## Conclusion

To apply, [please fill the form](https://forms.gle/NPBoJGcWbn3t3TgE6). We'll go through applications as we receive them (expect a delay of a few days) and the call will end after we have filled the volunteer quota.
