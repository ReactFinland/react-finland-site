The venue of [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) 2018 is a unique hall right in the old imperial center of Helsinki. [Valkoinen Sali](http://www.valkoinensali.com/) (White Hall in English) has origins in its past and it has hosted our presidents. If it’s good enough for them, it’s good enough for three hundred developers.

Valkoinen Sali suits a single track conference well. It was renovated in 2016 and you can expect the venue to be top quality. There’s a separate bar and a balcony for our gold sponsors.

Instead of trying to convince you that we picked a good place for the conference, have a look at the images below:
