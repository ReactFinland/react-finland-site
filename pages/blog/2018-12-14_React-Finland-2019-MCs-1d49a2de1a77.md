One of the improvements we are going to make for [React Finland 2019](https://react-finland.fi/) is the introduction of MCs. We’ll have two past speakers for this task, one for each conference day.

### Jani Eväkallio

[Jani Eväkallio](https://twitter.com/jevakallio) is one of the better known Finnish web developers out there. He gave a keynote last year and this time around he’ll keep us entertained during the first conference day.

In addition to MCing the sessions, he’ll host a special event — **#SMOOSH**. I don’t exactly know what’s in store but that sounds like a lot of fun.

### Sara Vieira
