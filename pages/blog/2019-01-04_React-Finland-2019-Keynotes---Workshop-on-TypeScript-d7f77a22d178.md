#### Michel Weststrate — MobX — The Journey

[Michel Weststrate](https://react-finland.fi/speakers/#michel-weststrate) is famous for developing MobX and pushing the art of state management further. In the first edition of React Finland he spoke about [immer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/immer), a solution designed to make it easier to write reducers for Redux.

Michel is an experienced practitioner in TypeScript and will hold [a full day workshop about the topic](https://react-finland.fi/workshops/#typescript-from-novice-to-expert). The workshop is aimed primarily for TypeScript beginners.

Given the language is becoming a mainstream option, this workshop is a good choice. I spent most of the year with the language this year and I can see how it improve your development experience while making refactoring safer and easier.

> If you already enrolled to a workshop and want to participate in Michel’s instead, let us know (info <at> react-finland.fi) and we’ll change your ticket.

#### Rick Hanlon — React Native

[Rick Hanlon](https://react-finland.fi/speakers/#rick-hanlon) from Facebook will discuss React Native and where it’s going in his keynote for the second day.

Rick is well known for his contributions to Jest, a popular testing choice for React projects, and will be a great addition to the roster of React Finland.
