The mini-conference about state management took place 27th of August. It was our second online event and it seems we have found a good format by now.

> The mini-conference sessions are available as a [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-a9lBflNu2oC5Rit5oW9hFVdGJrzEW6Q) as they finish.

## David Khourshid - Introduction to Statecharts

The event started with David Khourshid's introduction to statecharts. He live-coded through a simple example to explain the approach.

The lecture was part of our premium offering and it's now available to the public as well.
