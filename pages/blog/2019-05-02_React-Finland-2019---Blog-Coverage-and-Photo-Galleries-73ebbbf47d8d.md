[Like in the previous year](https://medium.com/react-finland/react-finland-2018-blog-coverage-e65bcece8946), [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi) has inspired bloggers to take up their virtual pens and write about the event. I’ll cover the posts I am aware of in this post so you can learn more about the conference.

To get idea of the atmosphere of the event, check the video I produced below (thanks to [Glenn Reyes](https://twitter.com/glnnrys) for shooting the last bit):

Patrick Hund created [a series of sketch notes about the conference](https://ebaytech.berlin/react-finland-2019-sketch-notes-64316793809e). I’ve included one above to give you some idea. They are a great way to get an overview of our sessions.

Patrick has multiple talents and he was one of the DJs for our Berlin themed afterparty on Friday.

> We also had [David Leuliette](https://twitter.com/flexbox_) to draw a series but you’ll see these drawings later in our blog posts.

#### Summaries of React Finland 2019

![We did podcasts! More information to come.](img/1__YHeZL3ZmxWCkSSLyiM4fLg.jpeg)
We did podcasts! More information to come.

There are multiple summaries of the event online, check out the following:

- [Artem Sapegin’s summary](https://blog.sapegin.me/all/react-finland-2019/) — Artem seems to be a great fan of the conference and the summaries get to the point!
- Boris Serdiuk’s summaries of [day 1](https://gist.github.com/just-boris/c5489afd181bb0bbd2501cfbbe9f56b7) and [day 2](https://gist.github.com/just-boris/2080a0595464c1554ea8b03005984f09) — Again, great summaries with a bit more detail.

#### Tatu Tamminen’s Recap of React Finland 2019

[Tatu Tamminen wrote about his general impressions of the event](https://www.triplet.fi/blog/react-finland-2019-recap/) and about the conference highlights. He liked the session format and the venue. We definitely took certain steps to the right direction this time.

I agree with him in that we should have had a couple of future looking talks and something about the new features of React. I’ll take these ideas into consideration when planning the next year!

#### Post-Conference Breakdown by Kenneth Sutherland

![React hooks APA by Kenneth Sutherland](img/1__8iL0G5xC2QRlzRBJraCFLg.jpeg)

Kenneth Sutherland wrote [a favorable review of React Finland](http://www.kennethsutherland.com/off-topic/react-finland-post-conference-breakdown/). He likes the friendly nature of the conference and the evening events where you can connect with other developers. Also the conference format (single track with themed sessions) is something he likes.

The conference workshop (performance) didn’t match his expectations but apart from that it looks like we did well!

#### React Conference Highlights by Andrey Okonetchnikov

Andrey Okonetchnikov, one of our speakers this year, had the chance to visit both [React Amsterdam](https://react.amsterdam) and React Finland. [He wrote about the conference highlights](https://medium.com/@okonetchnikov/2019-react-conferences-highlights-dbf084769682) and mentioned both conferences favorably. There are also design system and styling related notes to digest.

#### React and Serverless by Matti Petrelius

Due to unfortunate scheduling, [Serverless Days Helsinki](https://helsinki.serverlessdays.io) overlapped with React Finland and led to some confusion as people had to choose between the events. Some communication didn’t happen despite tries and we ended up running at the same time.

Matti Petrelius was a speaker at Serverless Days while having a chance to visit React Finland for a day as well and [he wrote notes on both conferences](https://lesscodeismore.dev/react-and-serverless/). He felt React Finland is a community event and that’s the way we want it to be.

#### React Finland 2019 tapahtumakatsaus by Herkko Huttunen

![Meiko crew at Nik’s workshop](img/1__7YX1BmzKa__e__rTJAcn3S3g.jpeg)

In this [conference report by Herkko Hukkunen of Meiko (Finnish only)](https://meiko.fi/blogi/react-finland-2019-tapahtumakatsaus), he mentions they came to the event with seven developers. In addition to participating in the workshops, they enjoyed the main event and networking aspects of the conference.

#### React Finland 2019 — Maailman huiput tapasivat Helsingissä

[In the conference report by one of our organizers](https://www.punosmobile.com/blog/react-finland-2019-maailman-huiput-tapasivat-helsingissa/) (Finnish only), Samuli Hakoniemi, he recaps the experience from an organizer point of view. It’s a cool read and gets to the point we want to highlight with the conference — it’s a communal event by heart and a great showcase of Finnish developers as well.

#### React Finland Photo Galleries

![Bear with me — one of the conference bears/beers](img/1__0kjyBJoc3OeU__XwvjpdVjw.jpeg)

People took plenty of photos during the event. I’ve listed the galleries I’m aware of below:

There are still photos to come but the above should give you some idea of the conference.

#### Conclusion

For me, React Finland was a great success and there’s still plenty to come. In case I missed your post or gallery, let me know and I’ll add a link!
