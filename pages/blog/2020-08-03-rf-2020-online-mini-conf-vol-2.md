Given we had to postpone the physical portion of the React Finland to the next year, we'll run with the same themes in a mini-conference format. Each of the events covers a specific topic. Last time [we discussed documentation](/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-1-recap/).

## Overview

In the second edition, we'll focus on the topic of state management. It has always been a hot issue when it comes to React, and I expect you'll gain more insight on where we might be heading if you join the session.

The event will take place 27th of August (16:45-20:40 Finnish time, public portion begins 17:30) and it's going to be available both in free and premium formats. To "pay" for the free option, you'll see themed advertisements during the breaks while the premium stream receives the QA. The QAs will be available later and included to the videos that are shared after the event.

This time around, we are improving the format by making the timing less loose. To make sure our premium audience gets additional value, we'll start the event with an introduction to statecharts by David Khourshid. You'll also have a chance to ask questions from him after the brief lecture.

The free/premium split allows us to keep the event accessible for all while giving us a chance to try to cover production costs.

## Schedule

As last time, we have three great speakers and an MC waiting for you. You might remember Sara Vieira from our earlier React Finland events, and she'll host us as the MC this time around.

The premium portion of the event begins 16:45 and the public stream starts at 17:30. After the end panel (premium only), we continue with a relaxed Zoom meeting starting at 20:10 and ending whenever people head out to other things (officially 20:40).

### David Khourshid - Introduction to statecharts - 16:45-17:30 - Premium only

David Khourshid, familiar from our earlier events and the author of [XState](https://xstate.js.org/), will start the event with an introduction to statecharts. There will be a brief QA after the lecture itself as you'll learn how this technology is making its way to the web and how it's going to simplify the creation of complex user interfaces with many states and transitions between them.

### Fireside chat and introduction - 17:30-17:45

Last time we did an experiment by starting the event with a fireside chat. The idea was to chat with our speakers in a casual manner before diving into technology. We found out it's a lovely way to begin as it gives the event a relaxed flavor, and we'll keep it in the schedule while cutting the length a notch to get faster to the tech bits.

### David Khourshid - Everything is an actor - 17:45-18:15

Here's how David describes his talk:

> If the word "async" scares you, you're not alone. Time is the one variable that introduces the most complexity in software. Thankfully, the Actor Model can hold the key to simplifying the reactive apps we work on. Learn how this nearly 50-year-old event-driven model can improve the way we architect complex apps.

In short, David will show us how the Actor Model can be used to simplify reactive applications while improving their architecture.

### Yan Lavryushev - Dive in Effector - 18:25-18:55

Yan Lavryushev will dive into a new state manager, [Effector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/effector), and you'll learn why you might want to use it in your project.

### Christian Alfoni - Stitches - 19:05-19:35

Christian Alfoni, famous for his work with state management solutions such as [Cerebral](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cerebral) and [Overmind](https://overmindjs.org/), will discuss [Stitches](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stitches/css). It's a new approach to styling that's utility first and gives you an excellent degree of control.

Here's what Christian has to say about his talk title "Reinventing CSS-IN-JS - The story of Stitches":

> We often feel discouraged when we have ideas and discover somebody else has done it before. Sometimes ignoring that fact can still lead to good things

Although the topic is outside of state management, it links the event to the third one of the series that's going to focus on design systems.

### Panel - 19:50-20:10

We'll wrap the event in the form of a panel to recap what we learned.

### Cooling down at Zoom - 20:10-20:40

There will be a chance to socialize at the end in Zoom. We'll share access through [React Finland Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/react-finland/shared_invite/enQtMzQ0NDM1ODczMjE2LTI3MjZlZGNjNTNkOTU5N2E1OWYxYzY0MWE0Y2NiNWMxMWZiMWEyYjc4MmM1ZDQwZmFhOTkyODBmM2E4NjcxZjM) when it's the time.

## What are the participation options

The session will be available in two formats - premium and free. The talks will be available freely through YouTube as we stream them simultaneously through another platform. Here's how the options differ:

- Free - Hosted on YouTube only, ads during breaks, minimal interactivity - 0 €
- Premium - Hosted on other platforms - You'll get an introduction to statecharts before the main event begins and have full access to the event QAs and the end panel - 30 € (inc. VAT)

The talk videos will be available through our YouTube channel later after the event.

## How to get a ticket

If you decided to move your React Finland conference ticket to the next year, we'll send you a free **premium ticket** to the event closer to the date. Otherwise, [please use our ticket provider and choose either a premium or a free ticket](https://fienta.com/react-finland-2020?e8677b7f3a2f2d38052763b8d1cd9117). There are still online workshop tickets available as well.

Depending on the choice, we'll send you a link with details later and remind you of the event.

## Conclusion

I hope to see you in our second online event to learn about state management with us!
