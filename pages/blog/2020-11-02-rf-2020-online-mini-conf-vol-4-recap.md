## Diego Haz - Reakit – Toolkit for building accessible UIs

In his talk, Diego Haz discussed [Reakit](https://reakit.io/), a UI toolkit for React that makes it easier to develop accessible component libraries. The talk covers the general approach and explains why Reakit was built the way it is.

## Luke Jackson - Oceanwind

In his discussion with Juho Vepsäläinen, Luke Jackson goes through [Oceanwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/oceanwind), a styling approach. Oceanwind implements the styling semantics of [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) but in an opposite manner.

Instead of coming with a CSS file with all the possible utility CSS rules, Oceanwind composes the required CSS based on usage. As a result, less tooling is required and the approach works both as a runtime and through server-side rendering while being performant and yielding good results.

## Mikhail Novikov - Lessons learned from burnout

In his discussion with Juho Vepsäläinen, Mikhail Novikov goes through the lessons he learned from burnout. As an industry, we seem to be particularly vulnerable to it and therefore it was an important topic to discuss in our conference series.

See [Fullstack health](https://fullstack.health/) for a podcast about the topic and [Understanding Job Burnout](https://itrevolution.com/understanding-job-burnout-christina-maslach/) article to learn more about the topic.
