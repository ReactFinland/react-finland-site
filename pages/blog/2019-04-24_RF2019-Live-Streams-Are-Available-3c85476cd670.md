React Finland 2019 has started in form of workshops. The main attraction will be of course the conference days.

To follow the tradition started with [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi), we’ll livestream the event apart from the comedy show to the public.

Tune it at the following urls:

- [Thursday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDkUpx0dVc0) (25.04)— [Schedule](https://react-finland.fi/schedule/#2019-04-25-first-conference-day)
- [Friday](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_BtZ8bv0sw) (26.04)— [Schedule](https://react-finland.fi/schedule/#2019-04-26-second-conference-day)

There will be video recordings later (like a week or two after the conference) and you can of course watch the longer videos meanwhile to get the talks.
