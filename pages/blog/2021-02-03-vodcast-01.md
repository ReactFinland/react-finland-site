As we had to postpone the live portion of React Finland last year, we moved to online events for now. We organized five mini-conferences with three speakers each, and now we're starting a series of vodcasts as we're changing the format.

## What's a vodcast?

Compared to the earlier online events, this one is more condensed, and coding focused. We call the new format a vodcast. You can think it more like a podcast but with a video. As it's not audio-only, we can show code easier and discuss it.

## Schedule

We have three guests awaiting you and Juho Vepsäläinen will host the session. The event begins 16:00 (GMT+0) 24th of February, and it should take roughly two hours, although we're flexible.

For the first event about React components, we've invited three guests to cover the topic:

- Pedro Duarte ([@peduarte](https://twitter.com/peduarte)) - [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/primitives/docs/overview/introduction) is a UI toolkit designed around component composition
- Anurag Hazra ([@anuraghazru](https://twitter.com/anuraghazru)) - [Renderlesskit](https://github.com/timelessco/renderlesskit-react) uses hook based composition for components
- Sascha Tandel ([@saschatandel](https://twitter.com/saschatandel)) - [Twind](https://twind.dev/) provides a styling approach inspired by Tailwind (successor of [Beamwind](https://github.com/kenoxa/beamwind) and [Oceanwind](https://github.com/lukejacksonn/oceanwind)) that has its implications for component design

It's going to be interesting to see the different ways we can design and compose our React components, and I hope fruitful conversations will come out of the session.
