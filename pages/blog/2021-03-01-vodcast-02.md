In [the previous vodcast](/blog/vodcast-01/) we covered React components. In the second event, we'll focus on accessibility.

The format felt good. Two hours of technical demonstrations and discussion fits online well, and it also allowed us to bring in comments from the YouTube audience.

## Schedule

Juho Vepsäläinen will host the session, and the event begins 16:00 (GMT+0) 29th of March and will last about two hours. Here's what we have in mind:

- Nicolas Steenhout [@vavroom](https://twitter.com/vavroom) will show us how to escape divsoup.
- Eeva-Jonna Panula [@EevisPanula](https://twitter.com/EevisPanula) gives us a lesson on motion.
- Amy Carney [@click2carney](https://twitter.com/click2carney) will share her experiences about refactoring a React application to be more accessible

## How to participate?

The event will be freely available and we will stream it to YouTube. Subscribe to the event below or [by using direct link](https://www.youtube.com/embed/jouctaXwpdU):
