Given we had to postpone the physical portion of the React Finland to the next year, we'll run with the same themes in a mini-conference format. Each of the events covers a specific topic. Last time [we discussed lessons learned](/blog/rf-2020-online-mini-conf-vol-4-recap/).

## Overview

In the fifth edition of the mini-conference series, we'll focus on React performance. It's a topic that remains relevant year after year and as usual, we have three sessions related to the topic.

The event will take place 2nd of December (17:30-20:10 GMT+2) and it's going to be available both in free and premium formats.

To "pay" for the free option, you'll see themed advertisements during the breaks while the premium stream receives the QA. The QAs will be available later and included to the videos that are shared after the event.

The free/premium split allows us to keep the event accessible for all while giving us a chance to try to cover production costs.

## Schedule

We have three speakers awaiting you and Juho Vepsäläinen will host the session. The event begins 17:30 and after the end panel (premium only), we continue with a relaxed Zoom meeting starting at 20:10 and ending whenever people head out to other things (officially 20:30).

I've listed the talks below. You can [learn more at the schedule](/schedule/).

### Milecia McGregor - Making Your React Apps Perform At Scale - 17:45-18:15

In the first session, Milecia McGregor will discuss how to make your React applications perform at scale. Here's how she describes her talk:

As you add more components to your React application, you'll start to notice performance issues. Maybe data isn't loading as fast or you notice that things are happening out of order. There are tools and techniques you can use to handle these kind of issue at a large scale. In this talk, attendees will learn how to analyze their React apps for solvable issues and learn some state management and async handling techniques.

### Nik Graf - Tips and tricks for optimizing your React application - 18:25-18:55

In the second sessions, Nik Graf will discuss through specific tips and tricks for optimizing React applications based on his experience with real world projects.

### Andrey Goncharov - Optimizing a React application - 19:05-19:35

In this conversational session, Juho Vepsäläinen will apply optimization techniques to a React application with Andrey Goncharov as they try out variety of techniques discussed during the event.

## What are the participation options

The session will be available in two formats - premium and free. The talks will be available freely through YouTube as we stream them simultaneously through another platform. Here's how the options differ:

- Free - Hosted on YouTube only, ads during breaks, minimal interactivity - 0 €
- Premium - Hosted on other platforms - You'll have full access to the event QAs and the end panel - 15 € (inc. VAT)

The talk videos will be available through our YouTube channel later after the event.
