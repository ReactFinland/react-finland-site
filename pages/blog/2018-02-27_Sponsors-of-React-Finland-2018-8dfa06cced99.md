You might recall [React Finland had a call for sponsors](https://medium.com/react-finland/call-for-sponsors-b193c561fa5) mid-January. There was more demand for sponsoring than we had sponsorship slots and sadly we had to turn companies down.

We used a Mersenne Twister and judgment to determine which companies to choose and I believe we have an excellent group of sponsors supporting the first iteration of the event.

Thanks to strong sales and sponsorship, we doubled our initial budget. As a result, we will have adequate resources for making the conference the best possible one for our roughly three hundred attendees.

Long story short, here are the sponsors of React Finland!

#### Gold Sponsors

[Gofore](https://gofore.com/en/home/) characterizes itself as “We create tomorrow’s digital services and work culture today” while [Solita](https://www.solita.fi/en/) states it’s a digital businesss company. You’ll learn more about both in the conference where the companies have booths. The companies may also have career opportunities available!

#### Partners

For a new conference, like React Finland, gaining visibility is essential. Even if the offering is good, it won’t matter unless people know about the offering. Partnering with other conferences and related resources is therefore essential and I believe it helped to generate awareness about the event.

For React Finland 2018, our partners are [AgentConf](https://www.agent.sh/), [HalfStack](http://halfstackconf.com/), [React Alicante](http://reactalicante.es/), [React Day Berlin](https://reactday.berlin/), [ReactFest](https://reactfest.com/), [React Native EU](http://react-native.eu/), [ReasonConf](https://www.reason-conf.com/), [SurviveJS](https://survivejs.com/), and [WebExpo](https://www.webexpo.net/prague2018/).

#### Conclusion

Even though it would have been possible to run the event without sponsors on retrospect, having strong support from the local companies and international partners allows us to run the conference on a higher level. We are proud to have gained the support and hope to give something great in return!
