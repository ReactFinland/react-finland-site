Running a conference like [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) isn’t free and although the majority of our budget comes from ticket sales (thank you!), it’s the sponsors that allow us to push the conference further in every sense. It’s you, the people coming to the conference, that help us to put together a basic conference and it’s the sponsors that put the icing on the cake.

#### Why Sponsorships Matter

I am humbled by the response React Finland has received from potential sponsors. In the end, there was more interest than there were slots but such is life. Now it’s our turn as conference organizers to make sure both our attendees and sponsors get value for their investment.

In addition to money, often sponsors provide us access to resources and help us to market the conference giving us reach to people we might otherwise miss. Due to this, we’ve managed to attract a significant number of foreign visitors to our northern country of Finland making the conference truly an international one.

#### How Does React Finland Handle Sponsorships

For React Finland, we continued on the model that was considered a good one before. We split sponsors into gold, silver, bronze, and partner levels. Levels from gold to bronze involve money while partnerships are a form of trade where we might promote another conference and they will promote us in turn.

The levels involving money have been limited by the amount to make sure the sponsors get value. It would be rather weird to have a conference with ten main sponsors after all.

#### Why Companies Sponsor React Finland

There are several reasons why companies might choose to sponsor our conference. As you might know, there’s fierce competition over talent in the field. By being visible in the right places, you might be able to retain your current talent better and attract new prospects to your business.

In part, it’s also about supporting your local community. Conferences like React Finland are places where people come together to learn together and from each other. It’s also where business happens as new connections are made.

Without further ado, let me introduce you to the sponsors of React Finland 2019! We are proud to be sponsored by these companies and organizations and hope to deliver the best conference we can thanks to their support.

#### Gold Sponsors of React Finland 2019

![Gofore, Futurice, and Digia — The gold sponsors of React Finland 2019](img/1__cPrtPxeOHFHeHN6GYYzdFw.png)

For React Finland 2019, we have three gold sponsors: [Digia](https://digia.com/), [Futurice](https://www.futurice.com/), and [Gofore](https://gofore.com/). I consider each a great example of Finnish software engineering and you will learn more about each at the conference in their lounge.

#### Digia — Creating a smoother digital world

Digia describes itself as a software and service provider that helps leading organizations develop their services, manage their business, and make efficient use of data at home and abroad.

As you might remember, they also sponsored [GraphQL Finland](https://graphql-finland.fi/) as one of the main sponsors. We are grateful for their support again.

#### Futurice — You cannot know the future but you can define it

According to Futurice, they help their clients unleash innovation through digital product design and build, emerging technology, agile software development, and lean organizational change.

Futurice runs [Spice Program](https://spiceprogram.org/) designed for open source and social impact. My only wish is that more companies would do something like this.

#### Gofore — Tomorrow’s digital services and work culture, today

Gofore is another of our returning sponsors (GraphQL Finland, gold level, same for previous React Finland) and we are happy to collaborate again.

Gofore states that digitalization brings endless opportunities to change the world for the better. It’s hard not to agree with the statement.

#### Silver Sponsors of React Finland 2019

![Alma, Elisa, Nightingale, Reaktor, and Solita — The silver sponsors of React Finland 2019](img/1__lHc9O9tUuk9Q2J9oQSd9Gg.png)

This time around we have a large variety of bronze sponsors. We did a mixed approach here as in some cases companies were willing to cover speaker costs (accommodation+travel) in return of a sponsorship.
