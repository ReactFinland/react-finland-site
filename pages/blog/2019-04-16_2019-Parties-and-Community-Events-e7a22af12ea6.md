Whenever thereâ€™s a bigger conference in town, it has an electrifying effect as it encourages people to set up their own events. Itâ€™s a great chance to meet the local developers and go sauna with them.

#### 23.04 (Tuesday) 18:00â€“21:00â€Šâ€”â€ŠReact Helsinkiâ€Šâ€”â€ŠAprilÂ Meetup

React Helsinki, the local user group, is having their April meetup one day before the conference. Youâ€™ll learn at least about React Native and micro-frontends there. Given thereâ€™s limited amount of space, [register now](https://meetabit.com/events/react-helsinki-april-2019).

#### 24.04 (Wednesday) 18:00â€“22:00â€Šâ€”â€ŠSauna withÂ Reaktor

One of our gold sponsors, Reaktor, wants to sauna with you. There will be also something drink/eat. For those participating in our workshops, there will be a shuttle (not a space one) from the venue to Reaktor offices. Again, the space is limited, so [please register.](https://www.reaktor.com/react-finland-afterparty/)

#### 25.04 (Thursday) 18:00â€“20:00â€Šâ€”â€Š#SMOOSH

After sold out shows in London and Berlin, weâ€™re bringing the [#SMOOSH comedy show](https://smoosh.fun) to Helsinki!

Join us for an evening of standup, improv, and even a sing-along. This show will be unforgettable, no matter how much you try to forget it. ðŸ˜‰

#### 26.04 (Friday) 18:00â€“23:00â€Šâ€”â€ŠAfterparty at TiivistÃ¤mÃ¶

Whatâ€™s a better way to end a week than to have an afterparty. Weâ€™ll go to a specific place, TiivistÃ¤mÃ¶, for this and weâ€™ll organize transport from the venue. Youâ€™ll have a nice chance to hang out with other developers in this space dedicated to us. Iâ€™ve also heard rumors of a DJ. We might skip karaoke, though.

#### Conclusion

I hope to see you at the events around the conference. Itâ€™s going to be a busy week!
