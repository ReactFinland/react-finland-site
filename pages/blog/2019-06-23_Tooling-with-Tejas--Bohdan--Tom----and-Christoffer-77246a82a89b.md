A mystery badge was found at the beginning of the tooling session

When it comes to technologies like React, the core library itself isn’t huge but there’s a lot of tooling around it. The purpose of the tooling session of [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi) 2019 was to cover some of that ground.

#### Tejas Kumar — Scalable (Design) Systems with TypeScript

One of the running themes in the conference was the topic of design systems and how to develop them.

In his talk, Tejas showed us how he developed his system — or rather specifically, how he combined [Styleguidist](https://react-styleguidist.js.org) with TypeScript and the editor from Visual Studio Code.

I hope Tejas’ work will find its way to Styleguidist one day!

- To hear Tejas’s thoughts about the topic, [go to 40:55 at the podcast](https://webbidevaus.fi/47).

#### Bohdan Liashenko — Codecrumbs in React

Even though a lot of time is spent understanding code and the way it works, a lot of our tooling isn’t designed the purpose in mind.

I invited Bohdan to the conference so he could demonstrate how his new open source tool, [Codecrumbs](https://codecrumbs.io), can help you develop against complex codebases and annotate them for your colleagues.

The basic idea is that you’ll annotate how a specific path of code through works across a codebase. These crumbs can then be shared with other developers in the team.

#### Tomáš Konrády — React Union: Write once, plug anywhere

Although developers often use React to develop single page apps, and increasingly static sites, there are times when you might want to integrate it into WordPress or perhaps Liferay! It is exactly this use case where [React Union](https://react-union.org) by Tomáš Konrády comes in.

#### Christoffer Niska — Releasing a library written in TypeScript on NPM

![Sketch notes by [David Leuliette](https://davidl.fr/)](img/1__RAoUB5mdW4qklv2BbB46gw.png)

Given there are so many moving bits these days, the question is, what to publish to npm and how to achieve it when using TypeScript. It was this question that Christoffer Niska explored in his talk.

#### Conclusion

I feel a lot of complexity of React comes from the tooling around it. That said, the situation is clearer now that create-react-app and other technologies have become the standard for many users. As shown by the session, there’s still innovation going on and I expect the tooling become more mature in the coming years as the community accepts new practices.
