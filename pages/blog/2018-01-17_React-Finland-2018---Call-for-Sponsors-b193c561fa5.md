Each medium post needs a more or less pointless header image!

Even though [React Finland](https://react-finland.fi/) is a non-profit conference, this doesn’t mean we don’t need money to run the conference. The entire budget for the conference is around 50.000 € and I designed the initial version of it without any external money (i.e. sponsors).

That said, I believe we’ll be able to provide a better conference for everyone involved with a limited amount of sponsoring. In addition to decreasing the financial risks related to organizing, it will also allow us to organize it better. In practice this means nicer service (free access to nearby sauna facility for example). We put the money back to the people instead of our pockets.

For this reason, [we are now looking for sponsors](https://react-finland.fi/for-sponsors/). Get in touch if your company is interested!
